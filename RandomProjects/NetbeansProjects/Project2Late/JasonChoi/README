##Discussion

It took me a while to take off with the song lables as I didn't know how to do that (then saw the song file).

Average time was the easiest for me as it was simple mathematics which are easy in java.

Saving the songs as an object took me a while for me to think it out as it is a bit complicated I feel personally.

I think the finding the shortests song was pretty straight forward but took a long time to do due to the sheer amount of coding involved with it.

Lastly I did not know how to do the testing check for this one so I needed to receive help from Elijah about the checking process.

I personally prefer do/while statement but it would not work for the detecting the order and printing since it would not print anything.

I tried to do double for the time average, but it would not work so I had to do float instead.

I tried to the whole project in NetBeans at first but could not figure out how to the thing with storing sons in the right place, so I just did it with notpad and terminal to run.
