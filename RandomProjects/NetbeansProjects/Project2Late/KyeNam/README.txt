## Overview

This java application prints out the Title, Artist Name, File path, the length of the song, the average time of the songs, and the song with play time closest to 240 seconds. 
It also plays songs everytime it resets.




## Compiling and Using

 - To compile, execute the following command in the main project directory :
'''
$ sudo chmod 777 garder.sh
'''

 - Run the compiled class with the command :
'''
$ ./grader.sh

The user will be prompted to a screen where it prints the Title, Artist, File Name and the Playtime of three songs
The printed information will also have the average playtime of three songs





## Discussion

This project prints out the Title, Artist Name, File path, the length of the song, the average time of the songs, and the song with play time closest to 240 seconds. 

This project needs "import java.util.*". to the In
First, I have wrote codes to prompt the user for song details. Then, I have used codes to convert the minutes and seconds String into an Integer to print them out as numbers. 
The next code I have written was the double time method and finalizing Song codes with a type of Scanner method. 
I repeated the Song description method three times since I have to printout 3 songs at once.
Next, I have written codes for printing out(Deciding) the code orders and there were multiple possible ways which I had to write out.

After writing all the basic codes leading up to the println method, I have printed out the Title, the Artist Name, the File path, the length of the song, the average time of the songs, and the song with play time closest to 240 seconds. 


The hard part of this project was using the "if" method. I didn't know if I had to put else if, so instead, I have put else([Stuff]) which I couldn't figure out what was wrong until I asked my classmate.
Owning a window machine for this project was very frustrating because I had to copy and paste in to ubuntu machine every time I wanted to test it out.
I used Mac to test it out but had hard time figuring out what the permission was. When I typed in my Mac password for the part where it asked for my password, it kept saying wrong password
So I had to come to school and test it out with a school ubuntu operating machine.

I used the zofia instruction and the Oracle website to go back and check the if method

I used the zofia instruction and the geeksforgeeks.org to refresh my mind with Scanner information
