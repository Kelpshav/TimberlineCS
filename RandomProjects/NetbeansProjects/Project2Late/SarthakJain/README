## Discussion
Since I had never used Netbeans before, I was really confused by its layout. However, when I started to use the starter code, I finally started to understand how it works. I did not know how the different codes were to be used in an amalmagation. I then messed around with the code and then found how to play the different songs with the user adding their input by using a scanner, if else statements, switch statements and case statements. I also did not know how to convert the time into seconds so I asked my cousin for help and he helped me out by suggesting that I use a parse int to convert the time.

This project was tough at first, but it was fun and I feel like I learned a lot about Java.
