# Project 2: Project PlayList

*Author: Minjun Kwak

## Overview
This program accepts song details from the user and prints a 
playlist, the average song playtime, and the song that has a 
playtime closest to 240 seconds.

## Compliling and Using
To compile, execute sudo chmmod 777 grader.sh
Then execute ./grader.sh while in the P2Test folder 
The inputted values by the grader will then be printed in playlist 
format with the average play time and the song closest to 
240 seconds printed

## Discussion
The goal of this project was to order three songs inputted by the user 
into a playlist sorted by playtime length, then play each song. To convert 
(mm:ss) to an integer, I used an array, a .split, and a parseInt. I sorted 
the songs by playtime using multiple if statements, comparing two playtimes 
twice to figure out which song was the smallest and largest and then using 
the or(||) to figure out which song was the second largest playtime. To figure
out the average time, I simply added the playtimes and divided by three. To 
figure out the song closest to 240 seconds, I subtracted each playtime by 240 
and took the absolute value, knowing that the number closest to 0 would then be 
the closest. I then compared each result to each other, printing the smallest
number which would be the song closest to 240.
