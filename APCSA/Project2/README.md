# Project Overview
In this project, you will develop an application that randomly generates four parking spots
and determines which parking spot is the closest to your current location.

# Objectives

- Write a class with a main method (FindParking).
- Use an existing, custom class (ParkingSpot).
- Use classes from the Java standard library.
- Work with numeric data.
- Work with standard input and output.

# Specification

- Existing class that you will use: ParkingSpot.java
- Class that you will create: FindParking.java

# ParkingSpot (provided class)

You are given a class named ParkingSpot that keeps track of the details about a parking
spot. Each parking spot instance will keep track of the following data.

- Name of the spot.
** The spot name must be specified when the spot is created (for example, "5th and main")
- Coordinates in a 2-dimensional city grid.
--The (x, y) coordinates must be specified when the spot is created.
â€“ The charge per 10 minutes interval.
--The default charge is 25 cents per 10 minute interval. As with all parking meters,
payment must be in whole intervals.
